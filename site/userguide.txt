.Import Note About This Document
*************************************************************************
This is a pared down version of the AsciiDoc User Guide intended to
simplify the process of assembling new themes and evaluating existing
themes. Please see
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[the official user guide]
for a comprehensive review of AsciiDoc features.
*************************************************************************

Text Formatting (`<h2>`)
------------------------
[[X51]]
Quoted Text (`<h3>`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Words and phrases can be formatted by enclosing inline text with
quote characters:

_Emphasized text_::
        Word phrases \'enclosed in single quote characters' (acute
        accents) or \_underline characters_ are emphasized.

*Strong text*::
	Word phrases \*enclosed in asterisk characters* are rendered
	in a strong font (usually bold).

+Monospaced text+::
	Word phrases \`enclosed in backtick characters` (grave
	accents) or \+plus characters+ are rendered in a monospaced font.

``Quoted text''::
        Phrases \``enclosed with two grave accents to the left and two
        acute accents to the right\'' are rendered in quotation marks.

#Unquoted text#::
        Placing \#hashes around text# does nothing, it is a mechanism
        to allow inline attributes to be applied to otherwise
        unformatted text (see example below).

The alternative underline and plus characters, while marginally less
readable, are arguably a better choice than the backtick and
apostrophe characters as they are not normally used for, and so not
confused with, punctuation.

Quoted text can be prefixed with an attribute list. Currently
the only use made of this feature is to allow the font color,
background color and size to be specified (XHTML/HTML only, not
DocBook) using the first three positional attribute arguments. The
first argument is the text color; the second the background color; the
third is the font size. Colors are valid CSS colors and the font size
is a number which treated as em units. Here are some examples:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[red]#Red text#.
[,yellow]*bold text on a yellow background*.
[blue,#b0e0e6]+Monospaced blue text on a light blue background+
[,,2]#Double sized text#.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

New quotes can be defined by editing asciidoc(1) configuration files.
See the 'Configuration Files' section for details.

.Quoted text properties
- Quoting cannot be overlapped.
- Different quoting types can be nested.
- To suppress quoted text formatting place a backslash character
  immediately in front of the leading quote character(s). In the case
  of ambiguity between escaped and non-escaped text you will need to
  escape both leading and trailing quotes, in the case of
  multi-character quotes you may even need to escape individual
  characters.
- A configuration file `[quotes]` entry can be subsequently undefined
  by setting it to a blank value.

[[X52]]
Constrained and Unconstrained Quotes (`<h4>`)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are actually two types of quotes:

Constrained quotes (`<h5>`)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Quote text that must be bounded by white space, for example a phrase
or a word. These are the most common type of quote and are the ones
discussed previously.

Unconstrained quotes (`<h5>`)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unconstrained quotes have no boundary constraints and can be placed
anywhere within inline text. For consistency and to make them easier
to remember unconstrained quotes are double-ups of the `_`, `*`, `+`
and `#` constrained quotes:

  __unconstrained emphasized text__
  **unconstrained strong text**
  ++unconstrained monospaced text++
  ##unconstrained unquoted text##

The following example emboldens the letter F:

  **F**ile Open...

[[X50]]
Inline Passthroughs (`<h3>`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This special text quoting mechanism passes inline text to the output
document without the usual substitutions. There are two flavors:

\+\++Triple-plus passthrough\+\++::
    No change is made to the quoted text, it is passed verbatim to the
    output document.

\$$Double-dollar passthrough$$::
    Special characters are escaped but no other changes are made.
    This passthrough can be prefixed with inline attributes.

Superscripts and Subscripts (`<h3>`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put \^carets on either^ side of the text to be superscripted, put
\~tildes on either side~ of text to be subscripted.  For example, the
following line:

  e^{amp}#960;i^+1 = 0. H~2~O and x^10^. Some ^super text^
  and ~some sub text~

Is rendered like:

e^{amp}#960;i^+1 = 0. H~2~O and x^10^. Some ^super text^
and ~some sub text~

Superscripts and subscripts are implemented as <<X52,unconstrained
quotes>> so they can be escaped with a leading backslash and prefixed
with with an attribute list.

Line Breaks (HTML/XHTML)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A plus character preceded by at least one space character at the end
of a line forces a line break. It generates an HTML line break
(`<br />`) tag. Line breaks are ignored when outputting to DocBook
since it has no line break element.

Rulers (HTML/XHTML)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A line of four or more apostrophe characters will generate an HTML
ruler (`<hr />`) tag. Ignored when generating non-HTML output formats.

Tabs
~~~~
By default tab characters input files will translated to 8 spaces. Tab
expansion is set with the 'tabsize' entry in the configuration file
`[miscellaneous]` section and can be overridden in the 'include' block macro
by setting a 'tabsize' attribute in the macro's attribute list. For example:

  include::addendum.txt[tabsize=2]

The tab size can also be set using the attribute command-line option,
for example `\--attribute=tabsize=4`

Replacements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following replacements are defined in the default AsciiDoc
configuration:

  (C) copyright, (TM) trademark, (R) registered trademark,
  -- em dash, ... ellipsis.

Which are rendered as:

(C) copyright, (TM) trademark, (R) registered trademark,
-- em dash, ... ellipsis.

The <<X7,Configuration Files>> section explains how to configure your
own replacements.

Special Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Words defined in `[specialwords]` configuration file sections are
automatically marked up without having to be explicitly notated.

The <<X7,Configuration Files>> section explains how to add and replace
special words.


[[X17]]
Titles
------
Document and section titles can be in either of two formats:

Two line titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A two line title consists of a title line, starting hard against the
left margin, and an underline. Section underlines consist a repeated
character pairs spanning the width of the preceding title (give or
take up to three characters):

The default title underlines for each of the document levels are:


  Level 0 (top level):     ======================
  Level 1:                 ----------------------
  Level 2:                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Level 3:                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Level 4 (bottom level):  ++++++++++++++++++++++

Examples:

  Level One Section Title
  -----------------------

  Level 2 Subsection Title
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[X46]]
One line titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One line titles consist of a single line delimited on either side by
one or more equals characters (the number of equals characters
corresponds to the section level minus one).  Here are some examples
(levels 2 and 3 illustrate the optional trailing equals characters
syntax):

  = Document Title (level 0) =
  == Section title (level 1) ==
  === Section title (level 2) ===
  ==== Section title (level 3) ====
  ===== Section title (level 4) =====

.Note
- One or more spaces must fall between the title and the delimiters.
- The trailing title delimiter is optional.
- The one-line title syntax can be changed by editing the
  configuration file `[titles]` section `sect0`...`sect4` entries.


[[X42]]
BlockTitles
-----------
A BlockTitle element is a single line beginning with a period followed
by a title. The title is applied to the next Paragraph,
DelimitedBlock, List, Table or BlockMacro. For example:

........................
.Notes
- Note 1.
- Note 2.
........................

is rendered as:

.Notes
- Note 1.
- Note 2.


[[X41]]
BlockId Element
---------------
A 'BlockId' is a single line block element containing a unique
identifier enclosed in double square brackets. It is used to assign an
identifier to the ensuing block element for use by referring links. For
example:

  [[chapter-titles]]
  Chapter titles can be ...

The preceding example identifies the following paragraph so it can be
linked from other location, for example with
`\<<chapter-titles,chapter titles>>`.

'BlockId' elements can be applied to Title, Paragraph, List,
DelimitedBlock, Table and BlockMacro elements.  The BlockId element is
really just an AttributeList with a special syntax which sets the
`\{id}` attribute for substitution in the subsequent block's markup
template.

The 'BlockId' element has the same syntax and serves a similar
function to the <<X30,anchor inline macro>>.


Paragraphs
----------
Paragraphs are terminated by a blank line, the end of file, or the
start of a DelimitedBlock.

Paragraph markup is specified by configuration file `[paradef*]`
sections.  AsciiDoc ships with the following predefined paragraph
types:

Default Paragraph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Default paragraph (`[paradef-default]`) consists of one or more
non-blank lines of text.  The first line must start hard against the
left margin (no intervening white space). The processing expectation
of the default paragraph type is that of a normal paragraph of text.

The 'verse' paragraph <<X23,style>> preserves line boundaries and is
useful for lyrics and poems.  For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[verse]
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

[verse]
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.

Literal Paragraph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Literal paragraph (`[paradef-literal]`) consists of one or more
lines of text, where the first line is indented by one or more space
or tab characters. Literal paragraphs are rendered verbatim in a
monospaced font usually without any distinguishing background or
border.  There is no text formatting or substitutions within Literal
paragraphs apart from Special Characters and Callouts.  For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
  consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
  homero verear ea mea, qui.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

  Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
  consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
  homero verear ea mea, qui.

[[X28]]
Admonition Paragraphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'Tip', 'Note', 'Important', 'Warning' and 'Caution' paragraph
definitions support the corresponding DocBook admonishment elements --
just write a normal paragraph but place `NOTE:`, `TIP:`, `IMPORTANT:`,
`WARNING:` or `CAUTION:` as the first word of the paragraph. For
example:

  NOTE: This is an example note.

or the alternative syntax:

  [NOTE]
  This is an example note.

Renders:

NOTE: This is an example note.

TIP: If your admonition is more than a single paragraph use an
<<X22,admonition block>> instead.

[[X47]]
Admonition Icons and Captions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NOTE: Admonition customization with `icons`, `iconsdir`, `icon` and
`caption` attributes does not apply when generating DocBook output. If
you are going the DocBook route then the <<X43,a2x(1)>> `--no-icons`
and `--icons-dir` options can be used to set the appropriate XSL
Stylesheets parameters.

By default the asciidoc(1) `xhtml11` and `html4` backends generate
text captions instead of icon image links. To generate links to icon
images define the <<X45,`icons`>> attribute, for example using the `-a
icons` command-line option.

The <<X44,`iconsdir`>> attribute sets the location of linked icon
images.

You can override the default icon image using the `icon` attribute to
specify the path of the linked image. For example:

  [icon="./images/icons/wink.png"]
  NOTE: What lovely war.

Use the `caption` attribute to customize the admonition captions (not
applicable to `docbook` backend). The following example suppresses the
icon image and customizes the caption of a NOTE admonition (undefining
the `icons` attribute with `icons=None` is only necessary if
<<X45,admonition icons>> have been enabled):

  [icons=None, caption="My Special Note"]
  NOTE: This is my special note.

This subsection also applies to <<X22,Admonition Blocks>>.


Delimited Blocks
----------------
Delimited blocks are blocks of text enveloped by leading and trailing
delimiter lines (normally a series of four or more repeated
characters). The behavior of Delimited Blocks is specified by entries
in configuration file `[blockdef*]` sections.

Predefined Delimited Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc ships with a number of predefined DelimitedBlocks (see the
`asciidoc.conf` configuration file in the asciidoc(1) program
directory):

Predefined delimited block underlines:

  CommentBlock:     //////////////////////////
  PassthroughBlock: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ListingBlock:     --------------------------
  LiteralBlock:     ..........................
  SidebarBlock:     **************************
  QuoteBlock:       __________________________

  Filter blocks:    code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    music~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <<X56,code>>, <<X57,source>> and <<X58,music>> filter blocks are
detailed in the <<X59,Filters>> section.

Special words   No          No        No        Yes       Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Listing Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ListingBlocks are rendered verbatim in a monospaced font, they retain
line and whitespace formatting and often distinguished by a background
or border. There is no text formatting or substitutions within Listing
blocks apart from Special Characters and Callouts. Listing blocks are
often used for code and file listings.

Here's an example:

  --------------------------------------
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
	  printf("Hello World!\n");
	  exit(0);
  }
  --------------------------------------

Which will be rendered like:

--------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello World!\n");
	exit(0);
}
--------------------------------------

Literal Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LiteralBlocks behave just like LiteralParagraphs except you don't have
to indent the contents.

LiteralBlocks can be used to resolve list ambiguity. If the following
list was just indented it would be processed as an ordered list (not
an indented paragraph):

---------------------------------------------------------------------
....................
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
....................
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:
....................
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
....................

The literal block has a 'verse' <<X23,style>> (useful for lyrics and
poems). For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[verse]
......................................
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.

Qui in magna commodo, est labitur
dolorum an. Est ne *magna primis
adolescens*.
......................................
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

[verse]
......................................
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.

Qui in magna commodo, est labitur
dolorum an. Est ne *magna primis
adolescens*.
......................................

SidebarBlocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A sidebar is a short piece of text presented outside the narrative
flow of the main text. The sidebar is normally presented inside a
bordered box to set it apart from the main text.

The sidebar body is treated like a normal section body.

Here's an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
.An Example Sidebar
************************************************
Any AsciiDoc SectionBody element (apart from
SidebarBlocks) can be placed inside a sidebar.
************************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which will be rendered like:

.An Example Sidebar
************************************************
Any AsciiDoc SectionBody element (apart from
SidebarBlocks) can be placed inside a sidebar.
************************************************

[[X26]]
Comment Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The contents of CommentBlocks are not processed; they are useful for
annotations and for excluding new or outdated content that you don't
want displayed.  Here's and example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
//////////////////////////////////////////
CommentBlock contents are not processed by
asciidoc(1).
//////////////////////////////////////////
---------------------------------------------------------------------

See also <<X25,Comment Lines>>.

Passthrough Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PassthroughBlocks are for backend specific markup, text is only
subject to attribute and macro substitution.  PassthroughBlock content
will generally be backend specific. Here's an example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<table border="1"><tr>
  <td>Cell 1</td>
  <td>Cell 2</td>
</tr></table>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Quote Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~
QuoteBlocks are used for quoted passages of text. 'attribution' and
'citetitle' named attributes specify the author and source of the
quote (they are equivalent to positional attribute list entries 1 and
2 respectively).  Both attributes are optional and the block body is
treated like a SectionBody. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Bertrand Russell, The World of Mathematics (1956)]
____________________________________________________________________
A good notation has subtlety and suggestiveness which at times makes
it almost seem like a live teacher.
____________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which is rendered as:

[Bertrand Russell, The World of Mathematics (1956)]
____________________________________________________________________
A good notation has subtlety and suggestiveness which at times makes
it almost seem like a live teacher.
____________________________________________________________________

In this example unquoted positional attributes have been used, the
following quoted positional and named attributes are equivalent (if
the attribute list contained commas then quoting would have been
mandatory):

  ["Bertrand Russell","The World of Mathematics (1956)"]
  [attribution="Bertrand Russell",citetitle="The World of Mathematics (1956)"]

You can render poems and lyrics with a combination of Quote and
Literal blocks. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[William Blake,from Auguries of Innocence]
_____________________________________________________________________
[verse]
.....................................................................
To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.
.....................................................................
_____________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which is rendered as:

And eternity in an hour.
.....................................................................
_____________________________________________________________________

[[X48]]
Example Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ExampleBlocks encapsulate the DocBook Example element and are used
for, well, examples.  Example blocks can be titled by preceding them
with a 'BlockTitle'.  DocBook toolchains normally number examples and
generate a 'List of Examples' backmatter section.

Example blocks are delimited by lines of equals characters and you can
put any block elements apart from Titles, BlockTitles and Sidebars)
inside an example block. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
.An example
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.
=====================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

.An example
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.
=====================================================================

The title prefix that is automatically inserted by asciidoc(1) can be
customized with the `caption` attribute (`xhtml11` and `html4`
backends). For example

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[caption="Example 1: "]
.An example with a custom caption
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.
=====================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[[X22]]
Admonition Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ExampleBlock definition includes a set of admonition
<<X23,styles>> (NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION) for generating
admonition blocks (admonitions containing more than just a
<<X28,simple paragraph>>).  Just precede the ExampleBlock with an
attribute list containing the admonition style name. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[NOTE]
.A NOTE block
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.

. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
. Donec eget arcu bibendum
  nunc consequat lobortis.
=====================================================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

[NOTE]
.A NOTE block
=====================================================================
Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
adolescens.

. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
. Donec eget arcu bibendum
  nunc consequat lobortis.
=====================================================================

Lists
-----
.List types
- Bulleted lists. Also known as itemized or unordered lists.
- Numbered lists. Also called ordered lists.
- Labeled lists. Sometimes called variable or definition lists.
- Callout lists (a list of callout annotations).

.List behavior
- Indentation is optional and does not determine nesting, indentation
  does however make the source more readable.
- A nested list must use a different syntax from its parent so that
  asciidoc(1) can distinguish the start of a nested list.
- By default lists of the same type can only be nested two deep; this
  could be increased by defining new list definitions.
- In addition to nested lists a list item will include immediately
  following Literal paragraphs.
- Use <<X15, List Item Continuation>> to include other block elements
  in a list item.
- The `listindex` <<X60,intrinsic attribute>> is the current list item
  index (1..). If this attribute is not inside a list then it's value
  is the number of items in the most recently closed list. Useful for
  displaying the number of items in a list.

Bulleted and Numbered Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bulleted list items start with a dash or an asterisk followed by a
space or tab character. Bulleted list syntaxes are:

...................
- List item.
* List item.
...................

Numbered list items start with an optional number or letter followed
by a period followed by a space or tab character.  List numbering is
optional. Numbered list syntaxes are:
.....................................................................
.  Integer numbered list item.
1. Integer numbered list item with optional numbering.
.. Lowercase letter numbered list item.
a. Lowercase letter numbered list item with optional numbering.
.....................................................................

Here are some examples:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  * Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  * Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
    adolescens. Sit munere ponderum dignissim et. Minim luptatum et
    vel.
  * Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
- Nulla porttitor vulputate libero.
  . Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  . Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  . Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
- Praesent eget purus quis magna eleifend eleifend.
  1. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    a. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    b. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    c. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  2. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  3. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  4. Nam fermentum mattis ante.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which render as:

- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  * Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  * Qui in magna commodo, est labitur dolorum an. Est ne magna primis
    adolescens. Sit munere ponderum dignissim et. Minim luptatum et
    vel.
  * Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
- Nulla porttitor vulputate libero.
  . Fusce euismod commodo velit.
  . Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    .. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    .. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  . Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
- Praesent eget purus quis magna eleifend eleifend.
  1. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    a. Fusce euismod commodo velit.
    b. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
    c. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  2. Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  3. Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  4. Nam fermentum mattis ante.

Vertical Labeled Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Labeled list items consist of one or more text labels followed the
text of the list item.

An item label begins a line with an alphanumeric character hard
against the left margin and ends with a double colon `::` or
semi-colon `;;`.

The list item text consists of one or more lines of text starting on
the line immediately following the label and can be followed by nested
List or ListParagraph elements. Item text can be optionally indented.

Here are some examples:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lorem::
  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

Ipsum::
  Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
Dolor::
  Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  Suspendisse;;
    A massa id sem aliquam auctor.
  Morbi;;
    Pretium nulla vel lorem.
  In;;
    Dictum mauris in urna.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Which render as:

Lorem::
  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

  Fusce euismod commodo velit.

Ipsum::
  Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Vivamus fringilla mi eu lacus.
  * Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
Dolor::
  Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.
  Suspendisse;;
    A massa id sem aliquam auctor.
  Morbi;;
    Pretium nulla vel lorem.
  In;;
    Dictum mauris in urna.

Horizontal Labeled Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Horizontal labeled lists differ from vertical labeled lists in that
the label and the list item sit side-by-side as opposed to the item
under the label. Item text must begin on the same line as the label
although you can begin item text on the next line if you follow the
label with a backslash.

The following horizontal list example also illustrates the omission

  - Donec eget arcu bibendum nunc consequat lobortis.

[WARNING]
=====================================================================
- Use vertical labeled lists in preference to horizontal labeled lists
  -- current PDF toolchains do not make a good job of determining
  the relative column widths.
- If you are generating DocBook markup the horizontal labeled lists
  should not be nested because the 'DocBook XML V4.2' DTD does not
  permit nested informal tables (although <<X13,DocBook XSL
  Stylesheets>> process them correctly).
=====================================================================

Question and Answer Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc comes pre-configured with a labeled list for generating
DocBook question and answer (Q&A) lists (`??` label delimiter).
Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question one??
        Answer one.
Question two??
        Answer two.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

Question one??
        Answer one.
Question two??
        Answer two.

Glossary Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc comes pre-configured with a labeled list (`:-` label
delimiter) for generating DocBook glossary lists. Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
A glossary term:-
    The corresponding definition.
A second glossary term:-
    The corresponding definition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For working examples see the `article.txt` and `book.txt` documents in
the AsciiDoc `./doc` distribution directory.

NOTE: To generate valid DocBook output glossary lists must be located
in a glossary section.

Bibliography Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc comes with a predefined itemized list (`+` item bullet) for
generating bibliography entries.  Example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
+ [[[taoup]]] Eric Steven Raymond. 'The Art of UNIX
  Programming'. Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-13-142901-9.
+ [[[walsh-muellner]]] Norman Walsh & Leonard Muellner.
  'DocBook - The Definitive Guide'. O'Reilly & Associates.
  1999. ISBN 1-56592-580-7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The `[[[<reference>]]]` syntax is a bibliography entry anchor, it
generates an anchor named `<reference>` and additionally displays
`[<reference>]` at the anchor position. For example `[\[[taoup]]]`
generates an anchor named `taoup` that displays `[taoup]` at the
anchor position. Cite the reference from elsewhere your document using
`\<<taoup>>`, this displays a hyperlink (`[taoup]`) to the
corresponding bibliography entry anchor.

For working examples see the `article.txt` and `book.txt` documents in
the AsciiDoc `./doc` distribution directory.

NOTE: To generate valid DocBook output bibliography lists must be
located in a bibliography section.

[[X15]]
List Item Continuation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To include subsequent block elements in list items (in addition to
implicitly included nested lists and Literal paragraphs) place a
separator line containing a single plus character between the list
item and the ensuing list continuation element.  Multiple block
elements (excluding section Titles and BlockTitles) may be included in
a list item using this technique.  For example:

Here's an example of list item continuation:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. List item one.
+
List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an
Indented block.
+
.................
$ ls *.sh
$ mv *.sh ~/tmp
.................
+
List item one continued with a third paragraph.

2. List item two.

   List item two literal paragraph (no continuation required).

-  Nested list (item one).

   Nested list literal paragraph (no continuation required).
+
Nested list appended list item one paragraph

-  Nested list item two.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

1. List item one.
+
List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by a Listing
block.
+
.................
$ ls *.sh
$ mv *.sh ~/tmp
.................
+
List item one continued with a third paragraph.

2. List item two.

   List item two literal paragraph (no continuation required).

-  Nested list (item one).

   Nested list literal paragraph (no continuation required).
+
Nested list appended list item one paragraph

-  Nested list item two.


[[X29]]
List Block
~~~~~~~~~~
A List block is a special delimited block containing a list element.

- All elements between in the List Block are part of the preceding
  list item.  In this respect the List block behaves like <<X15,List
  Item Continuation>> except that list items contained within the
  block do not require explicit `+` list item continuation lines:
- The block delimiter is a single line containing two dashes.
- Any block title or attributes are passed to the first element inside
  the block.

The List Block is useful for:

1. Lists with long multi-element list items.
2. Nesting a list within a parent list item (by default nested lists
   follow the preceding list item).

Here's an example of a nested list block:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
.Nested List Block
1. List item one.
+
This paragraph is part of the preceding list item
+
--
a. This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.

This paragraph is part of the preceding list item

b. List item b.

This paragraph belongs to list item b.
--
+
This paragraph belongs to item 1.

2. Item 2 of the outer list.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Renders:

.Nested List Block
1. List item one.
+
This paragraph is part of the preceding list item
+
--
a. This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.

This paragraph is part of the preceding list item

b. List item b.

This paragraph belongs to list item b.
--
+
This paragraph belongs to item 1.

2. Item 2 of the outer list.


Footnotes
---------
The shipped AsciiDoc configuration includes the `\footnote:[<text>]`
inline macro for generating footnotes. The footnote text can span
multiple lines. Example footnote:

  A footnote footnote:[An example footnote.]

Which renders:

A footnote footnote:[An example footnote.]

Footnotes are primarily useful when generating DocBook output --
DocBook conversion programs render footnote outside the primary text
flow.


Indexes
-------
The shipped AsciiDoc configuration includes the inline macros for
generating document index entries.

`\indexterm:[<primary>,<secondary>,<tertiary>]`::
`\(((<primary>,<secondary>,<tertiary>)))`::
    This inline macro generates an index term (the <secondary> and
    <tertiary> attributes are optional). For example
    `\indexterm:[Tigers,Big cats]` (or, using the alternative syntax
    `\(((Tigers,Big cats)))`.  Index terms that have secondary and
    tertiary entries also generate separate index terms for the
    secondary and tertiary entries. The index terms appear in the
    index, not the primary text flow.

`\indexterm2:[<primary>]`::
`\((<primary>))`::
    This inline macro generates an index term that appears in both the
    index and the primary text flow.  The `<primary>` should not be
    padded to the left or right with white space characters.

For working examples see the `article.txt` and `book.txt` documents in
the AsciiDoc `./doc` distribution directory.

NOTE: Index entries only really make sense if you are generating
DocBook markup -- DocBook conversion programs automatically generate
an index at the point an 'Index' section appears in source document.


Callouts
--------
Callouts are a mechanism for annotating verbatim text (source code,
computer output and user input for example). Callout markers are
placed inside the annotated text while the actual annotations are
presented in a callout list after the annotated text. Here's an
example:

.Explanation
- The callout marks are whole numbers enclosed in angle brackets that
  refer to an item index in the following callout list.
- By default callout marks are confined to LiteralParagraphs,
  LiteralBlocks and ListingBlocks (although this is a configuration
  file option and can be changed).
- Callout list item numbering is fairly relaxed -- list items can
  start with `<n>`, `n>` or `>` where `n` is the optional list item
  number (in the latter case list items starting with a single `>`
  character are implicitly numbered starting at one).
- Callout lists should not be nested -- start list items hard against
  the left margin.
- If you want to present a number inside angle brackets you'll need to
  escape it with a backslash to prevent it being interpreted as a
  callout mark.

Implementation Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Callout marks are generated by the 'callout' inline macro while
callout lists are generated using the 'callout' list definition. The
'callout' macro and 'callout' list are special in that they work
together. The 'callout' inline macro is not enabled by the normal
'macros' substitutions option, instead it has its own 'callouts'
substitution option.

The following attributes are available during inline callout macro
substitution:

`\{index}`::
    The callout list item index inside the angle brackets.
`\{coid}`::
    An identifier formatted like `CO<listnumber>-<index>` that
    uniquely identifies the callout mark. For example `CO2-4`
    identifies the fourth callout mark in the second set of callout
    marks.

The `\{coids}` attribute can be used during callout list item
substitution -- it is a space delimited list of callout IDs that refer
to the explanatory list item.

Tables
------
Tables are the most complex AsciiDoc elements and this section is
quite long. footnote:[The current table syntax is overly complicated
and unwieldy to edit, hopefully a more usable syntax will appear in
future versions of AsciiDoc.]

NOTE: AsciiDoc generates nice HTML tables, but the current crop of
DocBook toolchains render tables with varying degrees of success. Use
tables only when really necessary.

The following annotated examples are all you'll need to start creating
your own tables.

The only non-obvious thing you'll need to remember are the column stop
characters:

- Backtick (`) -- align left.
- Single quote (') -- align right.
- Period (.) -- align center.

Simple table:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
 `---`---
 1   2
